FreeBSD PKGNG bootstrap

For months FreeBSD has been prompting me to upgrade from pkg_ tools to pkgng, the next generation of their package management tools. In particular, using ports commands displays a link to a blog post with more detail. I’m embarking on that upgrade now, and the first problem was getting a new automatically deployed FreeBSD 8.4 machine to start using pkg. The manual process is easy:

# pkg
The package management tool is not yet installed on your system.
Do you want to fetch and install it now? [y/N]: y

Automating this wasn’t documented, nor available from my usual sources of advice, so I started to experiment.

# make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/pkg install
# pkg_create -xb pkg
pkg_create: no packages match pattern
# pkg_info
pkg_info: no packages installed
# pkg create -x pkg
Creating package for pkg-1.4.4

Okay, so pkg_ doesn’t know about pkgng, fair enough. How am I to get this pkg package installed without pkg being installed to install it?! Ye olde bootstrap problem. Dan Langille came to the rescue with a helpful command line:

env ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES=YES pkg bootstrap

This installs the latest package from default sources, and I suspect will be what I use in the majority of cases, but while starting

___________________to build that into our systems for testing, I noted something in pkg(8): “pkg-static is a statically linked variant

of pkg typically only used for the initial installation of pkg.” and then

# tar -tf pkg-1.4.4.txz
...
/usr/local/sbin/pkg-static

So the way to bootstrap entirely from the network, is to take that packaged package to a newly installed FreeBSD 8.4 machine, and use the pkg-static within it to bootstrap the whole package:

# tar -xf pkg-1.4.4.txz --strip-components 4 /usr/local/sbin/pkg-static
# ./pkg-static add pkg-1.4.4.txz
# pkg2ng

The packaging system still doesn’t work though, because no repositories are defined:

# pkg update
No active remote repositories configured.
# pkg -vv | grep -A 9 Repositories:
Repositories:

Fixed with help from Romain Vrignaud’s blog post, but without quoting the enabled value, since it’s a boolean:

# mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos
# cat << 'EOF' > /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf 
FreeBSD: {
  url: "pkg+http://pkg.FreeBSD.org/${ABI}/latest",
  mirror_type: "srv",
  enabled: yes,
}
'EOF'
