note to disable an ehternet on a ubuntu computer by command line. 
sudo ifconfig eth1 down

1. shebang line:
the maximum length of the #! line varies from 63 to 1024 characters. Try to keep it less than 64 characters.

2. to prevent spoofing attacks.
$ cat nusers Show contents
#! /bin/sh - Magic #! line
who | wc -l Commands to run
The bare option – says that there are no more shell options; this is a security feature
to prevent certain kinds of spoofing attacks.



3. how to run multiple commands in shell script simultaneously (use of ampersand)
Finally,semicolons separate multiple commands on the same line. The shell executes
them sequentially. If you use an ampersand (&) instead of a semicolon,the shell
runs the preceding command in the background,which simply means that it doesn’t
wait for the command to finish before continuing to the next command.

4. major difference between printf and echo command in shell.
printf does not goes to newline but echo will go the newline

Note : logger command 

this command provides the logging functionality in unix 
in BSD it writes to /var/log/messages file and in ubuntu it writes to /var/log/syslog



5.REGULAR EXPRESSIONS:
BRE AND ERE
grep commands : basic introduction

finding a pattern searching a pattern and prints it

grep -E extended RE
grep -F fixed RE
     -f reads pattern from a file
	 -i ignores	lettercase when doing pattern matching.
	 -v prints line tha does not match the pattern. 
	 -q Be quiet. Instead of writing lines to standard output, grep exits successfully if mpattern matches or else exits 1

  1) matching single characters a.z with .
  2) with [] , ifconfig | grep -i R[U]N   , ifconfig | grep -i R[Up]N ; both will search for a word with three letters R and N.
  Supplying a caret (^) as the first character in the bracket expression complements
  the set of characters that are matched; such a complemented set matches
  any character not in the bracketed list. Thus, [^aeiouy] matches anything that
  isn’t a lowercase vowel,including the uppercase vowels,all consonants,digits,
  punctuation, and so on.
  3) expressions can be shortened to [0-9] and [0-9a-fA-F], respectively.
  
  
6.sorting-

sort filename
if contents are in numbers sorting is done in ascending order , if alphabets then sequentially.

sorting in reverse order , sort -r filename

rembmeber uniq utility

extracting n lines from first or last
head -n 3 words  (extracting first 3 lines from file word)
sed -e 3q words  also does the same task.

tail -n 3 words  (taking last 3 lines  from file word)

7. imp new: 
xargs it divides the contents of the output as arguments in a program.


8. to set the script to run in debug level.

before starting the script write below lines.
set -x
 before running the script we need to run below command.
 export PS4="DEBUG => "
 
 after this the output of the command will come in debug mode.

 --------------------------------------------
 Security in shell scripts.
 
 
 1.   never put .(dot) in PATH in shell scripts to make it more secure , it is a opwn door for torjan horses.
      executable specially should  come from full path.
	  
 2.  reset environment variables after use. 
 3. cd to a know directory and then . use relative pathnames  to known directory. also use exit 1 ; cd  scripts || exit 1
 4. always use full pathnames for commands.
 5. use syslog to capture logs and timestamp of file which are run.
 6. always quote user imput  while using it eg "$1"  and "$*".
 7. do not use eval on user inputs in a shell script.
 8. Suspected sybolic links to critical file systems. Whenever we perform chmod to files or edit files we must check if any symbolic links exists.
 9. Use setgid rather than setuid, if possible as relatively less damage can be done to group than uid.
 
 
 Note: IFS internal field seperator.
 
 
 
 Basic commands to list and display files.
 
 1. "echo /bin/*sh" will list the files containing sh at the last.  "ls  /bin/*sh | cat"
 2. "ls -1 "  only names in listwise.
 3. "ls -latrdg i(inodes)t"
 4. to calculate octal dump of a file.
      root@automate:~# ls  tes*ct | od -a -b
0000000   t   e   s   t   .   e   x   p   e   c   t  nl
        164 145 163 164 056 145 170 160 145 143 164 012
0000014



###Listing file metadata.

to display the metadata in more readable format we use octal dumps
to turn steams of unprinatable bytes into text format.

/proc filesystem


/tmp stores temporary files. gets deleted after reboots.
/var/tmp does not get deleted after reboots. It usually contains the files recovered after system crash.

Stick bits:  inorder to avoid the removal of any files from a folder in unix sticky bit it set to 1 to avoid deletion of folders
and files by mistake or intendedly.

how to set it "chmod 1755 test"  here 1 indicates sticky bit is set to 1. you will see a t in front of directories with sticky bit set to 1.
drwxr-xr-t  2 root root 4096 Aug  9 16:14 test
